                    BCM is a group that aims to make modular synthesis,
                    and music tech in general,
                    more accessible, understandable and available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are attempting to do this by having communal modular synth
                    systems that people can come and use, as well as running
                    workshops where people can build their own instruments and learn
                    what the electronics inside their synths is actually doing.

                <h2>Magnum Percussion Instrument</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of out plan for workshops, we recently designed a
                    version of the classic Star Synare drum synth we've called
                    the Magnum Percussion Instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's fully open source, with all design and project files
                    available, which you can find
                    <a href="https://github.com/bristol-communal-modular/magnum-percussion-instrument">
                        in the GitHub repository</a>.
